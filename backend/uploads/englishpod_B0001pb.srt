00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:07,600
Hello English learners and welcome to English Pod, my name is Marco.

2
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:14,200
I'm Amira and Amira and I are here today with a great, great lesson for you.

3
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:15,180
Yes, we are.

4
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:18,220
Today, we're going to be talking about a restaurant.

5
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:20,800
Amira, why don't you give us a little bit more details?

6
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:24,320
Well, we're talking about a situation in a restaurant

7
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:28,900
and two people are involved, the waiter and the customer.

8
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:30,760
And I don't want to say anymore.

9
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,480
Okay, don't say anymore, let's just listen to this dialogue

10
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,400
and we'll be back later to explain it.

11
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:47,700
Good evening. My name is Fabio. I'll be your waiter for tonight.

12
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:48,960
May I take your order?

13
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,360
No, I'm still working on it.

14
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:53,000
This menu is not even in English.

15
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:54,500
What's good here?

16
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:59,660
For you, sir, I would recommend spaghetti and meatballs.

17
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:02,040
Does it come with coconut fries?

18
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:09,020
It comes with either soup or salad and a complimentary glass of wine, sir.

19
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:14,700
I'll go with the spaghetti and meatballs, salad and the wine.

20
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:19,400
Excellent choice. Your order will be ready soon.

21
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:21,220
How soon is soon?

22
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:23,040
20 minutes.

23
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:26,700
You know what? I'll just go grab a burger across the street.

24
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:36,200
Oh, what a waiter.

25
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,520
What a waiter. He is really angry at this customer

26
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:43,860
and I can't blame him. I would be angry too.

27
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:50,680
Yeah, so I think, Marco, you have chosen some interesting expressions for us here.

28
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,140
What is the first one?

29
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:56,180
Well, the first one is I'm still working on it.

30
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,120
I'm still working on it.

31
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,400
I'm still working on it.

32
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,380
I'm still working on it.

33
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:06,760
Why don't we listen to some other examples on how you can use this word,

34
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,040
and then we'll come back and explain it.

35
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:16,660
Did you finish reading the magazine?

36
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:18,660
I'm still working on it.

37
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:23,500
Did you fix my call?

38
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:37,840
I'm still working on it.

39
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,380
I still need more time.

40
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,120
Fantastic.

41
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,240
Great. Okay, it's clear.

42
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:47,980
I have another one for you guys. It's a phrase commonly used and you'll hear it all the time.

43
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,200
Coke and fries.

44
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,620
Coke and fries.

45
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:57,580
Coke and fries. It's a short way of saying Coca-Cola and French fries.

46
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:01,140
So that's basically America's fast food.

47
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:03,500
Yeah, burger, Coke and fries.

48
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:06,380
Okay. What's next on the menu?

49
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:10,020
On the menu we have a complimentary glass of wine.

50
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,460
Complementary glass of wine.

51
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,340
Complementary glass of wine.

52
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,520
Complementary means...

53
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,500
That it's free.

54
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:19,520
Free. Yes.

55
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,440
We love that, huh?

56
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:22,620
Yeah, we definitely like free things.

57
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:27,180
Well, I have another one for us here. Another interesting phrase.

58
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:28,820
I'll go with.

59
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,040
I'll go with.

60
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,360
I'll go with.

61
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:32,840
I'll go with.

62
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,360
I'll go with.

63
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,480
Yeah, I'll choose or I'll take.

64
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:39,240
I'll take.

65
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:41,300
Okay, very good.

66
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:45,380
Alright, the next word that I want to take a look at is grab.

67
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:46,740
Grab.

68
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:47,840
Grab.

69
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:49,120
Grab.

70
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:56,300
Okay, now let's listen to some other examples of how we could use grab in different situations

71
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:59,120
and then we'll come back and explain it.

72
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:12,530
Wait for me, please. I need to grab my coat.

73
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:18,210
Let's grab a cup of coffee.

74
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:29,110
Alright, well, I would understand that go grab means go get quickly.

75
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:30,910
To go get quickly, yeah.

76
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:37,370
Yeah, alright everyone, so now it's time to listen one more time to the dialogue and listen carefully

77
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:41,710
and try to understand why the waiter doesn't like the customer.

78
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:42,710
Let's listen.

79
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:53,810
Good evening. My name is Fabio. I'll be your waiter for tonight.

80
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:55,070
May I take your order?

81
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:57,470
No, I'm still working on it.

82
00:04:57,850 --> 00:04:59,110
This menu is not even in English.

83
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:00,630
What's good here?

84
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:05,770
For you, sir, I would recommend spaghetti and meatballs.

85
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:08,170
Does it come with coconut fries?

86
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:15,090
It comes with either soup or salad and a complimentary glass of wine, sir.

87
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:20,830
I'll go with the spaghetti and meatballs, salad and the wine.

88
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:25,510
Excellent choice. Your order will be ready soon.

89
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:29,210
How soon is soon? 20 minutes?

90
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:45,070
You know what? I'll just go grab a burger across the street.

91
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:48,890
Well, he basically wasted the waiter's time.

92
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:51,170
I mean, this guy comes into the restaurant.

93
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:57,570
He is not very polite and he's asking all these questions in the end.

94
00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:02,110
He just gets up and says, ah, I'll just go grab a burger across the street.

95
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:07,190
Yeah, and I also think that this guy was a lot more casual than the place he was in, right?

96
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:13,150
Yeah, yeah, I think this was a nice fancy restaurant, so I think he was in the wrong place.

97
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:18,810
Yeah, so how many times Marco, tell me, do you really have fast food a week?

98
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:21,090
Fast food, let's see.

99
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:24,610
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.

100
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:25,990
Oh my god.

101
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:32,030
No, no. I think I get fast food maybe once a week, once or twice a week.

102
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:37,150
Alright, talking about fast food made me hungry, so I think I'm going to go grab something to eat myself.

103
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:38,350
Yeah, me too.

104
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:41,410
Alright, I hope you guys enjoyed the lesson today.

105
